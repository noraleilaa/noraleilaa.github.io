 *Hello There*
 
 
  My name is Nora Alaoui, I am a recent graduate from George Mason University (GMU) with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. And currently pursuing a Certificate in UI/UX Design from California Institute of the Arts. I am the Business Development Chair at an Untitled Beauty product startup, in which I am primarily in charge of strategies for growth and development of the business. I worked as a Research Assistant in the Social Skills Imagination Theatre lab (SSIT), that primarily researched which environment fosters the education of school aged children the best.At the SSIT lab I was delegated the task of encoding participants' responses into a database, encoding several hours of lectures, calling participants to participate in research, and contributing to discussions surrounding research. I also ran a supervised research study. I recently volunteered at SMART autism learning center in Rabat, Morocco. I helped the founders develop a growth strategy, presented specialized resources and funding opportunities aligning with the US education system. At SMART I learned the value of being able to leverage a business and to develop strategies to become a leader in Autism Education across the continent of Africa. I also worked at STEM tree, a science technology engineering and math tutoring center, creating learning materials that were distributed to further linguistics education. 


I am proficient in Microsoft Office suite, Adobe suite, Google Docs, SPSS, Web content management, SharePoint, and I am able to speak Russian and French. I also have experience coding in Java, as well as Python. I also have taken courses in Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks.

I am eager to have the opportunity to further discuss my skills and experience and hope to talk soon.
